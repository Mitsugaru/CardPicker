# CardPicker

Unity-based utility that lets you draw a single card from a deck of cards.

Cards can have a name, image, and a description. The deck can have a backing image as well.

Tap or swipe on the deck to draw a card. Alternatively, you can shake to draw a card.  Swipe vertically to discard / play the card. Swipe horizontally to redraw. Tapping on a drawn card will toggle the name and description of the card.
